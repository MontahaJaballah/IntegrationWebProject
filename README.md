Our team followed a structured UI/UX process, transforming ideas from prototyping to high-fidelity designs, which were then developed using React & Tailwind CSS.

🎨 Design Process.
We followed a structured approach to ensure a seamless user experience:

1️⃣ Prototyping: Brainstormed ideas and created rough sketches of the platform.<br>
2️⃣ Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Defined the core layout and user journey.<br>
3️⃣ Medium-Fidelity Mockups: Improved structure and added key UI elements.<br>
4️⃣ High-Fidelity UI: Applied colors, typography, and interactions to make the design visually appealing.<br>
5️⃣ Development: Coded the Figma designs into a fully functional web app using React & Tailwind CSS.<br>
