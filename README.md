We followed a structured approach to ensure a seamless user experience:

1️⃣ Prototyping: Brainstormed ideas and created rough sketches of the platform.
2️⃣ Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Defined the core layout and user journey.
3️⃣ Medium-Fidelity Mockups: Improved structure and added key UI elements.
4️⃣ High-Fidelity UI: Applied colors, typography, and interactions to make the design visually appealing.
5️⃣ Development: Coded the Figma designs into a fully functional web app using React & Tailwind CSS.
